**Task Overview**

Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. Visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors.

**Data Description**

The dataset used in the code appears to be related to traffic accidents. Here's a brief description of the columns present in the dataset:

1.Road_surface_type: Type of road surface where the accident occurred (e.g., dry, wet, icy).

2.Weather_conditions: Weather conditions at the time of the accident (e.g., clear, rainy, snowy).

3.Light_conditions: Light conditions at the time of the accident (e.g., daylight, dusk, darkness).

4.Cause_of_accident: Possible cause of the accident (e.g., speeding, distracted driving, vehicle malfunction).

**Output**

1.**Distribution of Road Surface Type:**

  A bar chart showing the distribution of accidents based on different road surface types. This provides insights into which road conditions are associated with a higher number of accidents.

2.**Distribution of Weather Conditions:**

  A bar chart displaying the distribution of accidents under different weather conditions. This helps in understanding how weather impacts accident rates.
  
3.**Distribution of Light Conditions:**

A bar chart illustrating the distribution of accidents under different light conditions. This gives insights into the relationship between visibility and accident occurrence.

4.**Distribution of Accident Causes:**

A bar chart showcasing the distribution of accidents based on their possible causes. This helps in identifying the most common factors contributing to accidents.
